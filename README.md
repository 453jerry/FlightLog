# FlightLog

This package implements a recorder to record runtime log to file.  

## How to use

Only need to invoke `LogRecorder.shared.record()`, Recorder will automatically log all stdout and stderr to a file. No need to modify `NSLog(_:)` or `print(_:)` in your code.

```swift
_ = LogRecorder.shared.record()
```

If you want the logs to have different levels, you can use the log enum.

```swift
Log.debug.write("This is a debug log")          // üîç This is a debug log
Log.info.write("This is a info log")            // üí¨ This is a info log
Log.warning.write("This is a warning log")      // ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a warning log
Log.error.write("This is a error log")          // ‚ùå This is a error log
```

Log enumeration also supports ignoring logs by log level.

```swift
Log.setIngore(levels: [.debug])
```
